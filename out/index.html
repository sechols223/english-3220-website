        <p>
          Welcome to my project website. This initiative details the creation of
          dedicated Community Technology Hubs at Southeastern Louisiana
          University. These hubs provide reliable internet access, digital
          skills training, and on-site support to students, faculty, and
          neighboring residents.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In todayâ€™s world, dependable internet and digital literacy are
            essential for success. Southeastern Louisiana University deserves
            on-campus technology centers that ensure every student and staff
            member can thrive academically and professionally.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am Samuel Echols, a senior Computer Science student at
            Southeastern Louisiana University. My expertise spans software
            development and user-centered design. Motivated by studies on the
            local digital gap, I designed this project to empower our campus and
            surrounding communities.

        <section id="problem">
          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Recent surveys show that nearly 30% of students and nearby
            households lack consistent high-speed internet. This limitation
            impacts remote learning, research access, and extracurricular
            engagement. Addressing this gap is critical for campus-wide
            inclusion.
